At this milestone rest    after all that

  racing about      torch-leaves

down on the ground for you      small red boats

  gathered there   the empty public road.



By this milestone wait       your bare feet

  on the stoneâ€™s stone       your face tipped up

to catch a bit of sun      your resting heart

   dissolving       even in simple rainwater.

 

Fare thee well  our hearts like brooches

  hung from the trees.     How far can you be?
